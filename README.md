# Taco Parser Kata

An exercise in geolocation, csv parsing, and logging

The data for this project had to be parsed from a CSV text file which contained location information (latitude and longitude) from a set of fast food restaurants in and near Alabama and used geolocation services in C# to determine the distance between each store with the goal of finding the two that were furthest apart.
